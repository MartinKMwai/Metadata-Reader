# Metadata-Reader

What this project does is extract metadata off any given videos. It is part of of a legacy web diary project 
where individuals can upload images and reciordings for posterity and to share with those you may authorise. For this 
to work one needs an upload folder under the project directory, and a node_modules file(this has too mant files so Github 
won't let me. I will be making changes on this from time to time so as to optimize it for it's eventual inclusion into the
mother-project codebase
